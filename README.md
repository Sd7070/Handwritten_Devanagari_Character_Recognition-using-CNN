# Handwritten_Devanagari_Character_Recognition-using-CNN
This repository contains the implementation of a project focused on recognizing handwritten Devanagari characters using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project explores the use of deep learning techniques to classify characters from the Devanagari script, which is widely used in languages like Hindi, Marathi, and Sanskrit.
